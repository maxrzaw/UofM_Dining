# U of M Dining
Me and 3 other University of Michigan Undergrads designed this app for our final project in our Elementary Programming Concepts course. We had 23 days from start to finish to teach ourselves enough swift to create this app. We presented it the EECS 183 Showcase against other teams final projects and were unanimously selected the winner.
